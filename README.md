Code representing the things I have learned throughout 
the course of my education, from my masters to my PhD.!



## A few important rules for myself.
1. Make use of the unittest suite and pytest
2. Make sure you adhere to the coding standards
3. Keep refining if need be.
4. Commenting to be done with any one standard (pick one that suits your needs )
   - Sphinx -Google -Numpy (Google for now)
