## Problem Statement
--------------------

A company director would like to know the following information about his employees:

1. Id 
2. Name
3. Salaries over the years (think about how to represent this data).
4. Years in the company (can be used for 3)
5. Position the employee holds

on top of the relevant information, the director wants to have 
a compact software, which can be web based or a desktop application
replete with a set of features which are enlisted as follows:

1. A Graphical User Interface.
2. Secure database (maybe using encryption).
3. Login/ Security system. Providing varied view levels
   based on the login.
4. An object oriented approach.

### Things to consider

* Approach (web based app or desktop app)
* Python libraries to use
* Design Pattern, Software Architecture
* Coding standards which would be robust 
  if outsourced to other companies.
* Test Driven Approach
* Database implementation 
* Sorting the lists viewed based on tabs/ columns present
